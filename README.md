# Woocommerce Category Disclaimer

This plugin can be used to create disclaimers or notes that you want to add to the end of the short description of every product in a category. It is worth noting that the "disclaimer" will be italicized to separate it from the rest of the content visually.

## Add content, including html tags, to the field in your chosen category

## and enjoy not having to copy and paste content across a whole category of products!

**NOTE:** If you are making a Variable Product make sure you type something into the Short Description. Otherwise, your disclaimer will populate the Variation Descriptions as well.
